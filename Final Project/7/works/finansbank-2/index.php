"Check"<br>

TYPE: Film
---
CLIENT: Finansbank
---
AWARDS: Cyrstal Apple Advertising Awards, Silver Apple
---
INFO: Finansbank is one of Turkey's biggest banks. This film launched VadeKart. It is a credit for SME’s (Small and Medium Enterprises) to replace check - the most common paying method in the Turkish market.

The idea of this film is based on the storyline of old Turkish style movies where the the father, who is a rich businessman tries to pay off the daughter’s lover. In Turkish films there is normally a conflict of interest and the father has to battle with the lover to persuade him to take the money and leave his daughter alone.

In this commercal it looks as though the love interest will live up to the expectation of the Turkish Films when he tears up the check.
